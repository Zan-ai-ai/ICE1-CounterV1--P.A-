# Set-Up Experiance #

The set up experiance was a bit challenging seeing that there was trouble with the Virtual machines, which in turn made it a bit hard to comprehand some of the concepts that the lecturer laid out. Thankfully the lesson was repeated, therefore understanding the concept of creating folders, using terminals and entering the correct code a bit easier.

# Set-Up Steps #

**1.** Open a new file in Visual Studio Code

**2.** Give your file a name 

**3.** Open the "App.tsx" folder to write your code 

**4.** Open the intergrated terminal to run code 

**5.** Run your emulator and use the "npx expo start" code in the Terminal to get the app running
